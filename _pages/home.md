**About Me**

A "Machine Learning Engineer" by professional title but in reality I tend to focus more on architectural design of machine learning systems. I started my professional work building simple linear regression based algorithm to forecast solar energy usage but overtime I moved from seeing the "machine learning" as the only part to one of the moving parts which should go through the same cycle of **test - deploy - integrate** phase, effectively  employing the concept of continuous integration and deployment.

I completed my Master's in Machine Intelligence from [IIITM, Kerala](www.iiitmk.ac.in) in 2018. A couple of interesting projects I worked on during that time which helped me understand basic concepts of developing learning based systems in research. *([Portfolio](https://saradindusengupta.ml/portfolio/)*)

My primary area of focus is computer vision, especially object identification and text extraction from multiple surface, and time-series forecasting and anomaly detection. I have spent my academic years and professional years as well focusing on these topics.

Currently I am focusing on designing and developing a forecasting and fault detection system to effectively monitor usage patterns and predictive maintenance of large scale li-ion energy storage systems at [Nunam](https://nunam.com).
