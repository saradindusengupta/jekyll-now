Contributions are welcome! Please add issues and make pull requests.  Fork from master and go from there.

If you make a pull request and change code, please make sure there is a closed issue tagged with 'code change' that has some comment linking to either the single commit (if the change was just one commit) or a diff comparing before/after the change. This is so that those who have forked this repo and modified it for their purposes can more easily patch bugs and new features.
