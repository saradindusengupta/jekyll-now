Analyzing EMR data from multiple sources and using metamap for building inference model to
identify potential clusters using Case Detection Algorithm, created an early detection model for
classifying disease clusters based on geographical nodes. Used `Pysyft` and `PyDP` for data security and
privacy by incorporating federated learning approaches in model development and serving.
