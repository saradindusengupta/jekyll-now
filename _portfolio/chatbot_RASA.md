Using `rasa_nlu` and `rasa_core` for building a production-ready conversational ai agent with integration for Slack, Google Assistant and Alexa bot platform. The conversational agent is intended to be used for any CRM platform and can be tweaked in such a way with very little configuration as the `rasa_nlu` and `rasa_core` were already trained with suitable stories derived from conversations.
