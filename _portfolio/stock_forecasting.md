Using technical indicators and twitter news tags, worked on a hybrid stock price forecasting
model using `LSTM` to be used for intra-day trading purposes where a small amount of trades needs to
happen in a short period. In the initial stage, worked with moderate accuracy on Nifty50 stock price,
with future work to be done with adding more indicators and processing other news tags as well.
